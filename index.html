                            If you're wondering how I was able to make this simple website, it's because one of our Information Technology classes includes Website Development. Please excuse the website's poor design as I am currently learning🙇🏼‍♂️

                        CSTC Sariaya is where I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. It was fun to be a college student, but I believe it will be even more exciting if we all learn together face-to-face.

                    During the pandemic, my desire to draw got even stronger. I opted to concentrate my attention on drawing because I have a lot of free time. When I see the full figure forms in these sketches and paintings that start with shabby lines, these gives me excited and want to draw more.

                    The majority of my subjects these days are humans, particularly anime and manga characters. I like painting still life as well, but I find them to be more restrictive. Animal figures are my favorite subject to paint since they allow me to be more creative.

                            Since we all have a lot of free time during this pandemic, cooking is both a hobby and a household responsibility for me. My mother taught me how to prepare a variety of foods, ranging from salty to sweet. This activity was enjoyable for me since I had complete control over what I put on the dish I prepared. The satisfaction I get from preparing delicious food gives me a sense of independence. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            In addition, my mother enjoys baking, and when I have free time, I frequently join her in the kitchen to assist her. My favorite part is seeing how the small cupcakes rise from the oven and, of course, tasting them.

                    The majority of what I've learned, particularly different painting and drawing styles, has come from YouTube's fantastic content creators. I always set out at least an hour to watch video tutorials, PewDiePie videos, or other Youtubers.
